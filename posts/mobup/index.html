                <h2>1. intro</h2>
<p>For the past year, I have been working on a project at work that involves Next.js.
I'm mostly a backend focused engineer but decided to tread into the front-end
world a little and have a look around. We picked Next.js for its ease of use
and it suited the project requirements well. It's supported by a group of
serverless functions written in .NET and so far, it's been a great pleasure
to work with. So, to get to know Next.js better, I decided to learn it, but
seriously learn it. And my preferred method of learning is by doing. So, I
thought, &quot;why not build a task management app?&quot; -- so cliché, you might be
thinking -- but to turn it a little more fun and challenging, I decided to make it a
collaboration platform instead, where users would find teammates to pair up with
based on what skills they want to learn. For example, if someone has a Next.js
task, I can see that and pair up with them, even if they're part of a different
team. As a bonus, we could integrate this with Graph (we use MS Teams) and write
a bot that matches/messages users based on skills to learn and tasks.</p>
<p>Recommended by my colleague, I picked shadcn/ui as my component library. It's not
only beautiful and intuitive but the components are super well-designed and easy
to adapt to anyone's needs.</p>
<h2>2. challenges</h2>
<h3>auth and protected routes</h3>
<p>If you know how OAuth works, this shouldn't be too hard to grasp and implement.
However, the poor documentation from Auth.js made this a not so straightforward
exercise. So, understanding how to implement auth was probably the hardest
challenge, but fun nonetheless. Thankfully, ChatGPT came to the rescue and
guided me when I was stuck.</p>
<h2>3. some take-aways so far</h2>
<h3>edge runtime</h3>
<p>I soon came to realise that some code (middleware) gets executed on this &quot;thing&quot;
called the edge runtime, which is <em>not</em> node. This left me puzzled a few times
when all of the sudden my application would break when importing a dependency
that, in itself, depends on node packages.</p>
<p>So, what's the edge runtime?</p>
<p>Let's begin with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing">the wikipedia's definition of edge computing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Edge computing is a distributed computing model that brings computation and
data storage closer to the sources of data. More broadly, it refers to any
design that pushes computation physically closer to a user, so as to reduce
the latency compared to when an application runs on a centralized data
centre.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next's <em>edge</em> is based upon this concept. The point is to improve speed by
executing code closer to the user , in <em>a separate lightweight runtime</em>. This
is particularly useful for things like ensuring the user has a valid JWT and
redirection which does not require computation in the application server, in
other words, Node.</p>
<h3>node.js</h3>
<p>It's what brings JavaScript to the backend. I was never the biggest fan of
writing JS nor had an interest in learning it deeply, but after starting this
project and watching
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB8KwiiUGy0&amp;t=324s&amp;pp=0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv">this</a>
excellent documentary about the origin of Node.js, I can now understand its
attractiveness. Thanks to Node, you can write your own web servers with the
language of the browser. No need for context switching between PHP/.NET/Ruby
and JavaScript. Just do it all in one language. Ryan Dahl understood this pain
point and fixed it. On a side note, we now have <a href="https://deno.com"><em>Deno</em></a>, the
new, improved &quot;node&quot; with out of the box support for TypeScript and great
tooling eco-system -- like Go!</p>
<h2>4. what's next?</h2>
<p>I'm currently working on the core data models for mobup! using Prisma, and soon
I'll be writing an in-depth tutorial covering all the techniques I've learned
so far.</p>
