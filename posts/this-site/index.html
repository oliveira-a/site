                <p>I used to have a blog but decided to shut it down at some point, for
some reason. Recently, I've been thinking about writing some stuff again
and finally gathered the energy to set something up. I picked
<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> as the static site generator - it's really
cool, check it out.</p>
<p>Anyway, expect to see some random blog posts about random stuff. I'm
keeping this blog as an historical registry of my learnings
throughout my journey in life!</p>
